        <hr>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row mt-5">
                <div class="col-md-6 bg-primary p-3">
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">1. Bootstrap 4 was released in January 2018, and it marked a significant advance over previous versions.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">2. Bootstrap 4 has five levels: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">3. Bootstrap 4 includes jquery and all associated plug-ins.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">4. Bootstrap 4 provides a few colors for a web page.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">5. Bootstrap 4 is compatible with both Internet Explorer 10 and 11.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">6. Radio buttons and checkboxes appear differently in different operating systems and browsers. The form takes advantage of whatever basic browser features are available.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">7. Bootstrap 4 uses fewer CSS properties.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">8. There is no off-canvas element.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 bg-danger p-3">
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">1. Bootstrap 5 was released in May 2021. This version came after multiple iterations of alpha and beta releases, and as a result, it had a slew of important additions and new features.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">2. Bootstrap 5 has six levels: xs, sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">3. Jquery has been deleted and replaced with vanilla JS and several functional plug-ins in Bootstrap 5.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">4. Extra colors insert into the looks, and the card's color palette was upgraded. There are a variety of colors to pick from the Bootstrap 5 framework.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">5. Bootstrap 5 does not support Internet Explorer 10 and 11.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">6. The appearance of form elements will not change while using a different operating system or browser. The forms alternate and add form controls; they are not browser-dependent.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">7. Bootstrap 4 uses more CSS properties.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-white">8. The offcanvas component is now available.</p>

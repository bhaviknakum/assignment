// What is the use of Void (0)?

// In JavaScript, void(0) is often used as a technique to prevent the browser from navigating to a new page when clicking on a link or button that has a href attribute with the javascript: protocol. This is commonly used as a way to create "dead" or inactive links that perform no action when clicked. The void operator in JavaScript evaluates the expression within it and always returns undefined. When used with (0), it's just a way to evaluate 0 and then discard the result, essentially preventing any action or navigation from occurring.
